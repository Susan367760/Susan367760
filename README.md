### 👋 Hey there! I'm Susan 

 a full stack developer who loves crafting powerful web applications. 💻

🌐 I specialize in backend languages like Python, Node.js, Java, and Mysql for building the core functionality of applications.

🖥️ On the frontend side, I enjoy working with JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, Vue.js, and of course, HTML/CSS to create intuitive user interfaces.

🚀 Always eager to learn and explore new technologies to enhance my skills. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects together!
